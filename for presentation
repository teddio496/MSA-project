for the presentation this is what we are going to do

so first we talk about our "real topic" how social media affect mental health.

and maybe at the end of the presentation,
we put this brief 5 to 10mins introduction 
to our website(making process)

which is mainly going to be about what we have learned to accomlpish this website

1.HTML,css explain the basics of them 
 website just with HTML
 website with a beginner level css
 interactive website

2.Javascript 
 I show the nav-bar function and how it fades in

3.Python
 Barak will probably do this
 Try to explain about how back end developing is also challenging
 and explain that you had to learn a "THE LANGUAGE" for the project
 just to make it sound more work
